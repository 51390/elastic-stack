# Elastic Stack Sandbox

Sandbox repository for playing around with Elastic Stack projects.

## Setup

Current versions of Elasticsearch require a higher `vm.max_map_count` setting then some Linux setups specify by default. To workaround
that issue, you can run

```
$ make setup_vm_max_map_count
```

Which will sudo and run _sysctl_ for setting that configuration with an acceptable value. You can do that yourself,
however. Take a look at the [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html)
in case of doubt on how to proceed.

## Usage

```
$ make run
```

Will bring up a single-node ES cluster with a Kibana instance to match.

Versions default to 8.9.0 but can be changed with:

```
$ VERSION=<version> make run
```

E.g.:

```
$ VERSION=8.0.0 make run
```

Note that for major versions other than 8, some changes or additions may be required
in the configuration. You can use .env files for a given major version to achieve that.

If not already created `.env` files are initialized in the `stack` directory:

 - `stack/.env_elasticsearch_<major version>`
 - `stack/.env_kibana_<major version>`

These files can be used to customize the configuration of that specific stack component.
Some are already provided when default config settings are required for the component execution.

To use the instances just hit:

 - Elasticsearch: http://localhost:9200
 - Kibana: http://localhost:5601

# Custom Ports

If you want to run multiple instances, or for any reason change the default ports, set the following variables:

- `ELASTICSEARCH_PORT`
- `KIBANA_PORT`
- `LOGSTASH_PORT`

E.g.:

```
$ ELASTICSEARCH_PORT=9299 KIBANA_PORT=5699 LOGSTASH_PORT=9699 make run
```
